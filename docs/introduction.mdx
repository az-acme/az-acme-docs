There are many ACMI clients that exist, but ```az-acme``` is different in that it has been designed from the outset with a focus on Microsoft Azure and aligned to the following goals.

- Replicate certificate management capabilities for ACMI based certificate issuers that exist natively between Azure Key Vault and Digicert / GlobalSign to make ACMI feel like a first-class capability.
- Store certificates in Azure Key Vault to enable existing Azure native integrations between services and Azure Key Vault to operate as expected. This also provides architectural advantages when establishing multi-cluster configurations for AKS as certificates are managed externally, and synchronished to the cluster.
- Separate TLS certificate management processes from Azure compute resources (this means *only* ACME DNS challenges are supported).  No need to deploy additional infrastructure required by other solutions.

The following shows how ```az-acme``` fits within the certificate management context. To certificate consumers, there is no difference between using a certificate managed by an Azure Key Vault native issuer (Digicert / GlobalSign) and those obtained from an ACMI based issuer via ```az-acme```(s).

The ```az-acme``` CLI can be added to existing CI/CD or automation tools and scheduled to run every 12/24 hours to perform the renewal checks as requried. Using existing operational tools means alerting and notifications have already been established, making it simpler to introduce and run across teams.
