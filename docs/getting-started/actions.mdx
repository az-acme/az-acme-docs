A GitHub action has been created to allow simple integation into your existing pipelines. All actions that can be performed via the ```az-acme``` CLI can also be run using the GitHub Action.

:::tip

It is recommended to use private agents if possible so you can restirct the Azure Key Vault to be accessible via Private Endpoints.

:::

A complete example of using the GitHub Action is shown below, including using the [azure/login@v1](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login) action for authentication.
